# **1\. Hardware Input Contract (Wokwi / ESP32)**

The ESP32 (FuelGuard AI v3.3) emits a JSON payload over HTTP POST every \~6–7 seconds. This is the exact contract the backend must parse. No assumptions are made beyond this output.

## **1.1 Raw Hardware Payload (exact fields from device)**

| {   "t":          4632,          // uptime in milliseconds since boot   "fuel\_l":     2.93,          // fuel level in liters (float)   "fuel\_pct":   4,             // fuel level as percentage (integer 0-100)   "engine":     true,          // engine ON/OFF (boolean)   "door":       true,          // door open/closed (boolean)   "temp\_c":     22.0,          // temperature in Celsius (float)   "accel\_g":    \-2.71,         // acceleration in G-force (float, mid=0G)   "speed\_kmh":  5.9,           // speed in km/h (float)   "rate\_lhr":   0.00,          // fuel consumption rate in L/hr (float)   "trip\_sec":   0,             // seconds elapsed in current trip (integer)   "fuel\_used":  0.00,          // liters used in current trip (float)   "lat":        9.0320,        // GPS latitude (float)   "lon":        38.7469,       // GPS longitude (float)   "location":   "Home",        // named geofence location (string)   "geofence\_ok":true,          // whether vehicle is inside geofence (boolean)   "low\_fuel":   true,          // hardware-side low fuel flag (boolean)   "parking":    false,         // parking mode active (boolean)   "overspeed":  false,         // overspeed flag \>80 km/h (boolean)   "alert":      "Low fuel warning" // device-side alert string (string|null) } |

## **1.3 Backend-Added Fields (added on receipt, not from device)**

The backend enriches the raw payload with the following fields before storing:

| Field | Type | Source | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| deviceId | string | HTTP header / URL param | e.g. ESP32-001, identifies which device sent this |
| vehicleId | string | devices table lookup | Looked up from deviceId, e.g. V001 |
| receivedAt | ISO 8601 string | Server clock (UTC) | Exact server-side receipt timestamp |
| schemaVersion | string | Backend constant | e.g. '1.0', tracks payload version |
| source | string | Backend constant | 'hardware' or 'simulator' |

# **2\. Real-Time System Architecture**

## **2.1 Communication Model**

| Channel | Protocol | Direction | Used For |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Hardware → Backend | HTTP POST (REST) | One-way push | Telemetry ingestion from ESP32 |
| Backend → All Clients | WebSocket (ws://) | Server push | Live vehicle state, new alerts, all vehicles update |
| Frontend → Backend | REST (HTTP GET) | Request/response | Historical data, trips, alerts list, vehicle list |
| Frontend ↔ Backend | WebSocket | Bidirectional | Initial subscribe, receive live state |
| Backend → Backend | Internal function call | In-process | Rule engine, trip detection, alert generation |

## **2.2 WebSocket Architecture — How Live Data Reaches Frontend**

The backend maintains a single WebSocket server. When a new telemetry packet arrives from hardware via POST /api/telemetry, the backend:

* Validates and stores the packet (raw \+ normalized)  
* Upserts vehicle\_latest\_state table row  
* Runs alert rule engine  
* Broadcasts updated vehicle state to ALL connected WebSocket clients  
* Broadcasts any newly generated alert to ALL connected WebSocket clients

**WebSocket Connection Lifecycle:**

| 1\. Client opens:  ws://backend/ws 2\. Backend sends: { type: 'CONNECTED', payload: { connectedVehicles: \['V001','V002'\] } } 3\. Backend sends: { type: 'ALL\_VEHICLES\_STATE', payload: \[ ...latest state of all vehicles \] } 4\. Hardware sends POST /api/telemetry  →  backend processes  →  backend broadcasts:        { type: 'VEHICLE\_UPDATE', payload: { vehicleId, ...latest state } } 5\. If alert fires:        { type: 'ALERT\_FIRED', payload: { alertId, vehicleId, type, severity, message, ... } } 6\. Client disconnects: backend removes from active connections map |
| :---- |

**Server-Side WebSocket State Management:**

The backend maintains an in-memory Map of connected WebSocket clients:

| const clients \= new Map(); // key: ws object // value: { connectedAt, clientId } // On new telemetry received: function broadcastToAll(message) {   clients.forEach((meta, ws) \=\> {     if (ws.readyState \=== WebSocket.OPEN) {       ws.send(JSON.stringify(message));     }   }); } |

| :---- |

## **4.1 Server → Client Events (Backend broadcasts these)**

### **Event: CONNECTED**

Sent immediately when a client connects. Gives the client the current state of all vehicles.

| {   "type": "CONNECTED",   "payload": {     "connectedVehicles": \["V001", "V002"\],     "serverTime": "2026-05-18T10:00:00Z"   },   "timestamp": "2026-05-18T10:00:00Z" } |
| :---- |

### **Event: ALL\_VEHICLES\_STATE**

Sent immediately after CONNECTED. Full current state of every registered vehicle. Frontend uses this to populate the fleet overview before live updates start.

| {   "type": "ALL\_VEHICLES\_STATE",   "payload": {     "vehicles": \[       {         "vehicleId":       "V001",         "label":           "Truck Alpha",         "plateNumber":     "ET-4321",         "assignedDriver":  { "driverId": "DRV-001", "fullName": "Bekele Tadesse" },         "lastSeenAt":      "2026-05-18T09:58:00Z",         "fuelLiters":      2.93,         "fuelPercent":     4,         "engineOn":        true,         "doorOpen":        true,         "speedKmh":        5.9,         "accelG":          \-2.71,         "tempCelsius":     22.0,         "fuelRateLhr":     0.00,         "latitude":        9.0320,         "longitude":       38.7469,         "locationName":    "Home",         "geofenceOk":      true,         "parkingMode":     false,         "overspeedFlag":   false,         "deviceStatus":    "online",         "currentAlertLevel": "critical",         "activeTripId":    "TRP-0021"       }     \]   },   "timestamp": "2026-05-18T10:00:00Z" } |

**Request Body:**

| {   "username": "admin",      // string, required   "password": "yourpass"    // string, required } |
| :---- |

**Success Response — 200 OK:**

| {   "success": true,   "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",  // JWT, expires in 24h   "admin": {     "adminId":   "admin-001",     "username":  "admin"   } } |

| :---- |

## **5.2  POST /api/telemetry**

**Purpose: Receive telemetry from ESP32 hardware. This is the only endpoint called by hardware.**

Auth: Device token in header → X-Device-Token: \<hardcoded shared secret\>

**Request Body (exact hardware JSON):**

| {   "t":           4632,   "fuel\_l":      2.93,   "fuel\_pct":    4,   "engine":      true,   "door":        true,   "temp\_c":      22.0,   "accel\_g":     \-2.71,   "speed\_kmh":   5.9,   "rate\_lhr":    0.00,   "trip\_sec":    0,   "fuel\_used":   0.00,   "lat":         9.0320,   "lon":         38.7469,   "location":    "Home",   "geofence\_ok": true,   "low\_fuel":    true,   "parking":     false,   "overspeed":   false,   "alert":       "Low fuel warning" } |
| :---- |

The Device ID is read from the X-Device-Id request header. The vehicleId is derived by looking up the device in the devices table.

**Processing Pipeline (in order):**

* 1\. Authenticate device token from header  
* 2\. Read X-Device-Id header, look up device in DB → get vehicleId  
* 3\. Validate all required fields present and correct types  
* 4\. Generate UUID for telemetryId  
* 5\. INSERT into telemetry\_raw (rawPayload \= full body JSON)  
* 6\. INSERT into telemetry\_normalized (mapped fields)  
* 7\. UPSERT vehicle\_latest\_state with new values

# **6\. Trip Detection Logic**

Trips are computed entirely by the backend by watching engine state changes across telemetry records. The hardware sends trip\_sec and fuel\_used as running counters within what it considers a trip, but the backend derives its own authoritative trip records.

## **6.1 Trip Start**

| Condition: incoming telemetry has engineOn \= true           AND vehicle\_latest\_state.engineOn was false (or no previous state) Action:   1\. INSERT into trips:        tripId \= new UUID        vehicleId \= from telemetry        driverId  \= vehicle.assignedDriverId at this moment        startTime \= receivedAt        startFuelLiters \= telemetry.fuelLiters        startLat/Lon \= telemetry.lat/lon        status \= 'active'   2\. UPDATE vehicle\_latest\_state.activeTripId \= new tripId |
| :---- |

## **6.2 Trip In Progress**

| Condition: engineOn \= true and active trip exists Action (on each telemetry packet during trip):   1\. Compute incremental distance from last GPS point:        Haversine(prev lat/lon, current lat/lon) → add to running distanceKm   2\. Track maxSpeedKmh if current speed \> stored max   3\. UPDATE trips SET distanceKm, maxSpeedKmh WHERE tripId \= activeTripId |
| :---- |

## **6.3 Trip End**

| Condition: incoming telemetry has engineOn \= false           AND vehicle\_latest\_state.engineOn was true Action:   1\. UPDATE trips SET:        endTime \= receivedAt        endFuelLiters \= telemetry.fuelLiters        fuelUsedLiters \= startFuelLiters \- endFuelLiters        avgSpeedKmh \= average of all speed readings during trip        endLat/Lon \= telemetry.lat/lon        status \= 'completed'   2\. UPDATE vehicle\_latest\_state.activeTripId \= null |
| :---- |

# **7\. Alert Rule Engine**

Runs synchronously after every telemetry insert. All thresholds are in a config file (not hardcoded). Before inserting any alert, check for existing open alert of the same type \+ vehicleId to avoid duplicates.

## **7.1 Rule: LOW\_FUEL**

| Field | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| Trigger | telemetry.fuelPercent \< 15 OR telemetry.lowFuelFlag \== true |
| Severity | warning |
| Dedup | Skip if open LOW\_FUEL alert exists for this vehicleId |
| Driver link | violations table: yes, type \= FUEL\_DROP if also dropping |
| // Alert evidence object: {   "fuelLiters":  2.93,   "fuelPercent": 4,   "deviceFlag":  true    // whether device itself flagged low\_fuel } |  |

## **7.2 Rule: SUSPECTED\_FUEL\_DROP (Theft Detection)**

| Field | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| Trigger | engine OFF AND parking mode ON AND fuel drops \> THEFT\_DROP\_LITERS within THEFT\_WINDOW\_MINUTES |
| Thresholds | THEFT\_DROP\_LITERS \= 4.0 L, THEFT\_WINDOW\_MINUTES \= 5 |
| Severity | critical |
| Detection method | Query last N normalized records within window, compare fuelLiters |
| Driver link | violations table: yes, type \= FUEL\_DROP |
| // Evidence object: {   "fuelBefore":    40.5,   "fuelAfter":     32.1,   "dropLiters":    8.4,   "windowMinutes": 3,   "engineOn":      false,   "parkingMode":   true } |  |

## **7.3 Rule: OVERSPEED**

| Field | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| Trigger | telemetry.speedKmh \> 80 OR telemetry.overspeedFlag \== true |
| Severity | warning |
| Dedup | Allow new alert only if previous OVERSPEED resolved, or 10 min cooldown |
| Driver link | violations table: yes, type \= OVERSPEED |
| // Evidence object: {   "speedKmh":    95.2,   "threshold":   80,   "deviceFlag":  true,   "tripId":      "TRP-0021" } |  |

## **7.4 Rule: DOOR\_OPEN\_PARKED**

| Field | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| Trigger | doorOpen \== true AND engineOn \== false AND parkingMode \== true |
| Severity | warning |
| Dedup | Skip if open DOOR\_OPEN\_PARKED alert exists |
| Driver link | violations table: yes, type \= DOOR\_OPEN\_PARKED |

## **7.5 Rule: GEOFENCE\_VIOLATION**

| Field | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| Trigger | telemetry.geofenceOk \== false |
| Severity | warning |
| Dedup | Skip if open GEOFENCE\_VIOLATION exists for this vehicle |
| Driver link | violations table: yes, type \= GEOFENCE\_VIOLATION |

## **7.6 Rule: REFILL\_DETECTED**

| Field | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| Trigger | fuelLiters increased by \> REFILL\_MIN\_LITERS vs previous telemetry |
| Threshold | REFILL\_MIN\_LITERS \= 5.0 L |
| Severity | info |
| Dedup | Always create (refills are distinct events, not conditions) |
| Driver link | No violation created |

## **7.7 Rule: DEVICE\_STALE / DEVICE\_OFFLINE**

Run by a background job every 60 seconds (setInterval or cron), not on telemetry receipt.

| Condition | Status | Alert Type | Severity |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| now \- lastSeenAt \> 5 min | stale | DEVICE\_STALE | info |
| now \- lastSeenAt \> 15 min | offline | DEVICE\_OFFLINE | critical |

On status change: UPDATE devices.status, broadcast DEVICE\_STATUS\_CHANGE via WebSocket, create alert if not already open.

# **8\. Standard Error Response Format**

All error responses follow this structure:

| {   "success": false,   "error": {     "code":    "ERROR\_CODE\_CONSTANT",   // machine-readable     "message": "Human readable text"    // for logging/display   } } |
